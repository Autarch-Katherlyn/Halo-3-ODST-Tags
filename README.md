These tags are posted as is for others to use in their ODST campaign mods and Firefight mods. Please give credit when using them, that's all I ask.
The release contains all the assets seen in my Kat's ODST Campaign Mod and Firefight mod. It also contains some other things I was messing with.

This is my first time using Git so I'm not entirely sure how things work.
